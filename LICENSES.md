The experimental SmallVM adapter at

preserve its own licensing and attribution when integrated:

- [ArduinoCore-Zephyr](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-zephyr)

Review each upstream project's actual license and notices before copying files.
Having a device driver API available does not transfer upstream code ownership.
